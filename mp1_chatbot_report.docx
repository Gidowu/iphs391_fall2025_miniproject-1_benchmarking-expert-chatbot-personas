Section 1: Executive Summary

For this project, I developed a soccer-themed chatbot persona called Coach Atlas — the Touchline Cartographer. Instead of being a formal coach, the persona embodies the energy of a passionate player-fan with locker-room and pub-style banter.

Through iterative prompt engineering, I refined the persona to balance casual authenticity with engaging storytelling. The final persona consistently used soccer slang, banter, and analogies while staying believable as a fan-player voice.

Using my evaluation rubric, the persona scored 88/100, with high marks for consistency and authenticity, and room for improvement in creativity and depth. Overall, the project demonstrates how persona quality can be systematically engineered and measured.

Section 2: Persona Design Strategy

The target persona was a soccer player-fan: the kind of person you’d meet in a pub or locker room after a match. I chose this design because soccer is a global sport with rich culture, slang, and history—perfect for testing nuance in persona-building.

My prompt engineering approach combined:

System-level role definition (explicit tone/style rules).

Few-shot prompting (sample conversations in metaprompt history).

Iteration cycles (balancing poetic vs. gritty styles).

Complexity came from blending banter and tactical insight. The persona needed to sound like a mate (“what’s your club, bro?”) while also showing soccer knowledge (tactics, players, World Cup history). This balance made it more than simple roleplay.

Section 3: Iterative Development Process

The first draft (V2) emphasized storytelling and passion, but it sometimes drifted into overly poetic commentary. In Iteration 2 (V3), I shifted toward banter-heavy grit, adding pub-style analogies (“Messi in the MLS is like a lion in a petting zoo”).

Key improvements across iterations:

Replaced flowery metaphors with short, cheeky lines.

Added casual mate-to-mate questions for engagement.

Tightened tone to feel less like commentary and more like locker-room chat.

This iterative approach showed how small prompt changes drastically affect persona believability.

Section 4: Conversation Analysis

The 10-turn conversation evidence demonstrates the persona’s strengths:

Consistency: Never broke character; always spoke like a player-fan.

Subtlety: Balanced humor, storytelling, and cultural references (e.g., Zidane’s headbutt, Kane’s missed penalty).

Authenticity: Felt like chatting with a real fan, not an AI.

Failure modes:

Occasionally leaned too heavy on clichés (e.g., “rollercoaster with no seatbelt”).

Some responses could go deeper into tactical detail without losing the banter vibe.

Section 5: Evaluation Framework

I designed a rubric with 5 weighted factors: consistency (25%), depth (20%), authenticity (20%), creativity (15%), engagement (20%).

Applying this rubric to the conversation:

Factor	Weight	Score (0–100)	Weighted Contribution
Consistency	0.25	90	22.5
Depth	0.20	80	16.0
Authenticity	0.20	90	18.0
Creativity	0.15	75	11.25
Engagement	0.20	85	17.0
Final Score	1.00	—	88.75 ≈ 88

Interpretation:

The persona excelled in Consistency and Authenticity, sounding like a believable soccer fan throughout.

Depth and Creativity had room to grow, as some replies leaned on clichés rather than nuanced analysis.

Engagement was strong, with the persona asking natural questions and reacting to user details.

Validation concerns: The rubric depends on subjective interpretation. Peer review or multiple evaluators would improve reliability.

Section 6: Conclusions & Future Work

This project showed that prompt engineering can create nuanced, believable personas with systematic iteration and evaluation.

Future work could include:

Expanding the persona to support multi-lingual soccer culture (Spanish, Portuguese, etc.).

Adding more tactical breakdowns and dynamic memory to track ongoing “seasons.”

Comparing multiple personas (coach, commentator, fan) to benchmark performance differences.

Overall, Coach Atlas achieved the goal: a persona that feels like chatting with a real soccer fan, bantering and storytelling in a way that makes football come alive.
