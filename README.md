📌 Overview

This repository contains Mini Project #1: Benchmarking Expert Chatbot Personas for IPHS 391 (Fall 2025). The focus is on developing, testing, and evaluating a soccer-themed chatbot persona using iterative prompt engineering.

The persona, Coach Atlas — the Touchline Cartographer, embodies the raw energy of a soccer player-fan. Instead of being a polished commentator, Coach Atlas banters like a teammate in the locker room or a mate at the pub, blending football insight with cheeky analogies.

⚽ Methodology

Repository Setup – Public GitHub repo created.

Persona Development – Iterative prompt refinement (metaprompt history + final persona prompt).

Conversation Evidence – 10-turn chat exported in markdown showing persona performance.

Evaluation Framework – Rubric designed and refined (history + final version).

Analysis Report – Comprehensive write-up (mp1_chatbot_report.docx) documenting process, results, and conclusions.

Upload to Repo – All materials committed.

AI-Generated README.md – This file.

📖 Key Insights

Iterative prompt engineering is essential: small wording tweaks radically shifted tone.

Soccer culture (slang, analogies, pub banter) provides fertile ground for nuanced persona testing.

A structured rubric (0–100) gives repeatable scoring, making subjective impressions measurable.
