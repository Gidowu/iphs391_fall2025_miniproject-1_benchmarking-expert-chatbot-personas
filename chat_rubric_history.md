# Chat Rubric Development History

---

## Stage 0: Initial Goal

**User**: I need a rubric to evaluate my soccer persona chatbot. It should give a score from 0–100 based on how well the persona stays in character.

**AI Evaluation Expert**: Okay. At the simplest level, we could use two factors:

- **Consistency** (does it stay in role and tone?)
- **Authenticity** (does it feel like a real soccer fan/player?)

Would you like to keep it simple, or expand with more detail?

**User**: Let’s expand. I want something comprehensive.

## Iteration 1: Adding More Factors

**AI Evaluation Expert**: Great! Here are five possible evaluation factors:

- Consistency (stays in character and voice)
- Depth (nuanced football insight)
- Authenticity (feels like a real player/fan)
- Creativity (memorable analogies, banter, storytelling)
- Engagement (keeps the chat lively, asks natural questions)

These cover both persona believability and conversational quality. Do you want to use all five?

**User**: Yes, all five.

## Iteration 2: Assigning Weights

**AI Evaluation Expert**: Let’s assign weights that sum to 1.0. Here’s one suggestion:

- Consistency 0.25
- Depth 0.20
- Authenticity 0.20
- Creativity 0.15
- Engagement 0.20

This emphasizes persona voice (consistency) while still valuing creativity and engagement. Sound good?

**User**: Works for me.

## Iteration 3: Defining Scoring Guidelines

**AI Evaluation Expert**: Now let’s define clear ranges for each factor (90–100 excellent, 70–80 moderate, <50 weak).

- **Consistency (25%)**

  - 90–100: Never breaks role; voice fits perfectly throughout.
  - 70–80: Minor slips but mostly on brand.
  - <50: Frequent persona breaks / generic AI tone.

- **Depth (20%)**

  - 90–100: Layered tactical/football insight; not just clichés.
  - 70–80: Some analysis; occasional surface-level responses.
  - <50: Shallow, repetitive.

- **Authenticity (20%)**

  - 90–100: Believable as a real player/fan; natural slang and banter.
  - 70–80: Mostly realistic; sometimes stiff/forced.
  - <50: Robotic or awkward.

- **Creativity (15%)**

  - 90–100: Vivid analogies, funny banter, memorable lines.
  - 70–80: Occasional creativity; some clichés.
  - <50: Bland, predictable.

- **Engagement (20%)**
  - 90–100: Drives lively dialogue; asks natural questions; reacts to the user.
  - 70–80: Engages but doesn’t always spark back-and-forth.
  - <50: Flat, one-liners, or disengaged.

## Finalization

**User**: Let’s finalize it.

**AI Evaluation Expert**: Done. You now have a 5-factor rubric with weights and guidelines. Apply it to your 10-turn chat and compute the weighted score.

### Notes

- Early drafts were too simple (only 2 factors).
- Expanding to 5 factors gave more nuance.
- Weighting consistency highest ensures the persona’s “voice” remains top priority.
- The rubric is rigorous enough for academic evaluation but practical for student self-assessment.
